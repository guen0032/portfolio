# portfolio

When designing my web portfolio, I wanted to create a simple but visually appealing design. With my limited experience, I tried to make a layout that could be accomplished using my knowledge of the flex and grid systems. I was trying to explore a bit more typography and keep any imagery relevant to the desired impact of my design. One of the struggles that I ran into while working on my portfolio was that I didn't have enough projects or designs to be able to showcase my work. Instead I chose to speak a bit about the various things that I learned in the last two semesters since beginning this program. 

## Challenges
1. My first challenge during this assignment was getting my logo image to be overlayed on top of the welcome banner beside the text box. I was originally trying to place it in the container div of the banner and it was being positioned beside the background image pushing it off to the side. 

After placing the logo image in it's own div inside of the container div for the banner, I was able to position it as needed in a similar way that I positioned the text box through it's own assigned class.

2. Next, I was working on importing the web fonts that I wanted to use in my design. The problem that I encountered was that one of the fonts was an Adobe font, and I had only ever imported fonts from Google into the CSS stylesheet.

Luckily, I found that Adobe fonts can also be imported into web project, but directly through the HTML in the head tag just like linking the CSS stylesheet. 

3. The last problem I ran into was having my textboxes over the banners on the homepage and the contact page be able to responsively resize to the different breakpoints. Unfortunately this was not something I was able to figure out, and instead opted to use display: none; to remove them for the smaller breakpoints. 


### What I Learned
While working on this project I have learned that creating similarly structured elements or using elements with the same class names can speed up the process by creating universal stylings for those elements. For example, having the same class name for all column grid layouts to be used across multiple pages helps to lighten the load. 

I also learned that web development takes a lot of patience, a lot of practice, and is a non stop learning journey. Just when I feel like I'm getting the hang of it, something in my code will bug out, and I'm still learning to not panic when that happens.
